		<h1>Working Domain of The Green Empower Organization</h1>

		<p>This is the working domain of The Green Empower Organization. Here I will coordinate tasks and details related to our planning.</p>

		<p>We will need to do some transitions in our operation here.</p>
		<p>There will be a transition away from primary reliance on GitHub for our git hosting and web hosting.</p>
		<p>GitLab is an obvious replacement although there is Savannah too.</p>
		<p>There are also these new decentralized networks I want to move into.</p>
		<p>There is radicle in the code hosting space.</p>
		<p>Then there were some networks for hosting decentralized websites..</p>
		<p>I'm doing more research on Ethereum and other technologies.</p>
